1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Never give up control.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Live life on your own terms.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,999
 Yeah, no, I get what you're saying.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 But, uh, canter's canters, to hell with your canter.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,999
 I've been living with canter for the better part of a year.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,999
 By from the start, it's a death sentence.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,999
 It's what they keep telling me.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,999
 Well, guess what?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Every life comes with a death sentence.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,999
 So every few months I come in here for my regular scan,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,999
 knowing full well that one of these times,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 hell maybe even today.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,999
 I'm gonna hear some bad news,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 but I tell that.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,999
 Who's in charge?

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Me.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 That's how I live my life.
